# Utilizing VBA Scripting to Analyze Multiple Years of Stock Data

#Overview

The objective of this project was to create a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script that loops through three consecutive years of data for approximately 3,000 stocks and outputs summarizing information for each individual stock. The initial stock data was organized into five main categories: open price, close price, highest intraday price, lowest intraday price, and volume traded. This information was recorded for each individual stock for every single trading day throughout the course of a clendar year. Through the use of VBA, this data was analyzed to determine the annual variation for each individual stock, which was reported as both monetary changes and their corresponding percent changes, along with the total volume of each stock that was traded during the course of the year.
