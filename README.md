# Utilizing VBA Scripting to Analyze Multiple Years of Stock Data

#Overview

The objective of this project was to create a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script that loops through three consecutive years of data for approximately 3,000 stocks and outputs summarizing information for each individual stock. The initial stock data was organized into five main categories: open price, close price, highest intraday price, lowest intraday price, and volume traded. This information was recorded for each individual stock for every single trading day throughout the course of a calendar year. Through the use of VBA, this data was analyzed to determine the annual variation for each individual stock, which was reported as both a monetary change and a corresponding percent change, along with the total volume of each stock that was traded during the course of the year. This condensed data was then further analyzed to ascertain the specific stocks that achieved the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume traded during each calendar year. The application of VBA in this situation allowed for all of the data processing to be automated, preventing the need for a repetitive approach.

#Purpose

All of the stock data that needed to be organized and analyzed was organized into an excel workbook titled "Multiple Year Stock Data" that contained a seperate worksheet for each calendar year that was considered.
